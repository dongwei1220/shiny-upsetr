# shiny-upsetr
This is a shiny implementation deployed with docker of the [UpSetR](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/UpSetR) R package for UpSet plots.

# Running using Docker
To run shiny-upsetr on a Cloud please create a Docker image of it using the Dockerfile provided. Once the image is ready it can be run either locally or on a Cloud.

## Building the image
Then go into this folder and build your image, giving it a name by using this command :
```
docker build -t upsetr . 
```

## Starting a container
After you have built the image, you can create a container and run it locally:
```
docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 upsetr
```
Finally, the shiny-upsetr app will be accessible at http://localhost:3838
